import pandas as pd

df = df.read_csv("PATH")

If the PATH is with multiple \ (Back Slashes), pandas(or python) will have trouble dealing with it.

That might be caused by the priority of quote (") and slash (\)
Slash has a high priority than "
Which will destroy the string.

Use double \\ to easily fix the problem
